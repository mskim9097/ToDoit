# ToDoit  

## Overview  
ToDoit is a collaborative task management web application designed to simplify group productivity. It solves the challenge of coordinating tasks across teams by providing a shared platform where members can create, assign, and track reminders in real time. Key features include group task lists, deadline reminders, and role-based permissions, enabling seamless teamwork. Users benefit from reduced miscommunication, centralized task tracking, and automated reminders to stay on schedule.  

Developed as part of the **BCIT CST Program** coursework, this project applies Agile methodologies, user-centered design principles, and integrates Firebase for real-time synchronization. AI-assisted tools were leveraged for rapid UI prototyping.
